# Floby-and-Bloby-Tag
A game created for the 2022 Spring FBLA Connecticut Competition from Jerod Abraham from Shelton High School in Shelton, Connecticut. This game stars two friends, Floby and Bloby, as they play a game of tag with some interesting changes. You play as Bloby and use both and arrow keys and the 'enter' key to dodge Floby. Pressing the 'enter' key allows Bloby to move faster, as long as you still have stamina remaining. You have 3 lives and there are 3 different level types, each with a different stratagy required to beat them. These 3 level types repeat and Floby's speed increases as well. You can also control Bloby with both the arrow keys, as well as with WASD. You can also reload the game with the 'r' key and quit the game and close the tab with the escape key.
